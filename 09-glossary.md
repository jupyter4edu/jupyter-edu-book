# Glossary {#glossary}

**Anaconda**: a free, open-source package manager, environment manager, Python distribution,
and collection of
[over 1,500+ open source packages](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/)
including and also Jupyter.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: a specification of what a
programmer must write or define to interact with a software library.

**Binder**: a hosted service that allows anyone to launch their own sandboxed notebook environment from
a Git repository. <https://mybinder.org>

**cell**: the area in a Jupyter Notebook where you can enter markdown, or computer code.

**cloud, in the**: used to describe software or documents hosted on a remote computer
accessed over the internet.

**CSV (Comma Separated Values)**: referring to a comma-separated value file.
A plain-text file format such that each line is a list of data separated by commas.

**DataFrame** A common tabular data structure with rows and columns available
in R and in Python through Pandas.

**execute**: technical term for having the computer perform the instructions of your program.
Alias for "run it."

**extension, Jupyter**: in this instance, it is not a request for more time.
Rather, a Jupyter extension is a bit of code, often developed by a third-party,
that adds additional functionality to Jupyter. For example, a popular extension is a
Table of Contents creator.

**flipped classroom**: a teaching style where students work on their own outside of class
to learn new material (sometimes by watching recorded lectures or reading descriptive/interactive
notebooks) and the come together in the classroom to practice what they've learned through
exercises or experiments.

**Git**: a popular version control system (VCS) used for keeping track of changes of files over time.

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: software that assists in the development
of additional software.

**Jupyter**: The term "Jupyter" may refer to one of a couple of different things:
a community of users and developers focused on the open source software; the collection
of tools and standards that, together, allow projects like the Jupyter Notebook to operate.
The name refers to the three core programming languages supported:
Julia, Python, and R.

**JupyterHub**: a cloud service that can provide access to Jupyter notebooks and
environments to multiple users via a modern web browser. <http://jupyter.org/hub>

**kernel**: In Jupyter, a kernel is the packaging up of a language, and related programs
needed to run it. For example, Python2 and Python3 are separate kernels.

**LMS (Learning Management System)**: a cloud service that helps instructors manage
aspects of classrooms.

**load**: how many students can a computer support?

**Markdown**: a text format that allows for basic formatting (headers, text styles, links)
mixed inline with the text.  Markdown files usually have the extension `.md` and
can be rendered natively by GitHub and other tools.

**magic**: a meta-command typically starting with one or two percent signs.
Changes the meaning of the contents of a line (one percent sign, `%`) or the cell
(two percent signs, `%%`) from code to a particular meta-instruction.
For example, `%%R` indicates that the cell contents will be interpreted as commands
to the R language. Magics are kernel-specific (e.g., vary with the kernel in use).

**nbgrader**: a tool for creating, handling, and automatically grading assignments
based on Jupyter notebooks. <https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io>

**nbviewer**: a web application for rendering Jupyter notebooks as static web pages,
providing a URL to share and view them with a modern web browser. <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org>

**nbconvert**: a tool for converting Jupyter notebooks into other formats such as
PDF, HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, reStructuredText, and others. <https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io>

**notebook hidden state**: a technical term referring to the value of variables
that may have surprising results due to cells having been executed in a non-sequential order.

**open source**: software and documents that are created in a manner that give you
rights to be able to use, and reproduce.

**pattern**: A "pattern" is a technical term referring to an abstract description
of a labeled process. For example, "wash, rinse, repeat" is a common pattern for
cleaning various objects.

**scaffold**: A teaching and learning pattern that provides steps in the
learning process that build on prior learned knowledge.

**service, JupyterHub**: JupyterHub can take advantage of additional separate,
but integrated, software extensions. These are called "services."

**script**: a colloquial term for a computer program.

**unit test**: a technical term for a "test" for checking to see if software is operating correctly.

**URL (Universal Resource Locator)**: the address of a resource (e.g., webpage) on the internet.

**widget**: a user interface (such as buttons, sliders, and checkboxes) that allow
the easy control of hidden computer code.
